This is a blog, sort of. It's a list of ideas, meant to help junior developers practice their coding skills and learn something new by problem solving without guidance or limitations.

#### Difficulty

Each spec is rated (fairly) approximately for difficulty, and these are:

|                                                      |   |            |
|-----------------------------------------------------:|:-:|:-----------|
|    <span class="post-difficulty easy"></span> &nbsp; |   | easy       |
|  <span class="post-difficulty medium"></span> &nbsp; |   | medium     |
|    <span class="post-difficulty hard"></span> &nbsp; |   | hard       |
| <span class="post-difficulty extreme"></span> &nbsp; |   | extreme    |

This *should* help you figure out what to expect from each undertaking, but even still there are a few things to keep in mind.

#### Stuff to remember

- This site won't teach you best practices, and in fact, won't teach you anything â€” it's just ideas to play with.
- There aren't any guidelines related to how you get the job done, that's up to you. Although it is worth mentioning that you'll probably want to have a decent grasp on html, css and js for the majority of it.
- You don't have to follow the specs, but it's probably worth trying to hold yourself to some sort of requirements.
- If you think something on here sucks, or could just be improved a little bit: fork it, change it.
