# Specs
a list of coding practice tasks

## About
This is a blog, sort of. Itâ€™s a list of ideas, meant to help junior developers practice their coding skills and learn something new by problem solving without guidance or limitations.

This brings along the caveat that there is nothing preventing you from writing **bad code**.

As a result of this, one should be careful when approaching these tasks, and use of websites such as *stackoverflow* and *MDN* are highly recommended to help with a lot of questions.
